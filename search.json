    "text": "Hi everyone,\nWelcome to my first post! Today, I‚Äôm looking at ChatGPT‚Äôs ability to do understand the structure of Census data. The data are organized into different PDFs as follows.\n\nPart 1: United States and Geographic Divisions\nPart 2: Akron, OH ‚Äì Des Moines, IA\nPart 3: Detroit, MI ‚Äì Memphis, TN\nPart 4: Miami, FL ‚Äì Salt Lake City, UT\nPart 5: San Antonio, TX ‚Äì Youngstown, OH\n\n\nThe task\nI was curious if ChatGPT would be able to tell me which section would contain data for Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nNot a great start\n\n\nInspired by the concept of prewarming or internal retrieval described in Prompt Engineering for Generative AI (Phoenix and Taylor 2024), I decided to ask ChatGPT if it could find a pattern in the file structures. Then, referencing our previous exchange where it discovered the pattern, I would ask it to try the task again.\n\n\n\n**Better!\n\n\nOk, time for the internal retrieval to shine.\n\n\n\nAlmost there‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nPros: ChatGPT was able to remember that it had previously found that the files were ordered alphabetically when I started the next prompt with ‚ÄúWith that in mind‚Äù.\n\n\nCons:  ChatGPT is not correctly retrieving the order of the alphabet.\n\nAfter expressing some doubt in the alphabetization, ChatGPT was able to provide me with the correct answer.\n\nAnd just to be sure, I asked it about a different US city, and it was able to complete the task.\n\n\n\nSo, could this have been done all in one prompt?\nI closed out my current session of ChatGPT and tried to create one prompt that would make ChatGPT do some sort of internal retrieval.\nI ended up trying this:\n\nHi! I have a two part question. These are pdf names that have housing data for various US cities in 1950. * Part 2: Akron, OH ‚Äì Des Moines, IA * Part 3: Detroit, MI ‚Äì Memphis, TN * Part 4: Miami, FL ‚Äì Salt Lake City, UT * Part 5: San Antonio, TX ‚Äì Youngstown, OH\n\n\nQuestion 1: Why do you think Akron, OH comes before Des Moines, IA, and Des Moines, IA comes before Detroit, MI? Explain your reasoning. Question 2: Which pdf do you think Philadelphia, PA would be in? Explain your reasoning.`\n\nChatGPT was able to correctly answer Question 1: saying ‚ÄúThe cities are likely listed in alphabetical order (from A to Z), which is why Akron, OH appears before Des Moines, IA, and Des Moines, IA comes before Detroit, MI‚Äù.\nBut when it came to Question 2, there was more work still to be done.\n\nThen I thought maybe a three part question would help:\n\nQuestion 1: Why do you think Akron, OH comes before Des Moines, IA, and Des Moines, IA comes before Detroit, MI? Explain your reasoning. Question 2: Can you please print out the order of the alphabet? Question 3: Which pdf do you think Philadelphia, PA would be in? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\nSigh! I will have to try this again some other time once I‚Äôve learned more about prompting strategies."
