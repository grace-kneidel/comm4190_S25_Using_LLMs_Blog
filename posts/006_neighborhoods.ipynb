    "I'm thinking about moving to a different neighborhood in Philadelphia. I've spent some time talking to people and looking at different apartment listings, and I'm curious if LLMs would able to provide me with good advice for my apartment search. \n",
    "\n",
    "My goals: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I want to experiment with the `system_role` parameter in the OpenAI API. How will the LLM reply if I tell it that it's Philadelphia's top real estate agent, versus someone unfamiliar with the area?\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. I want to gain a better understanding of knowledge cutoffs. ChatGPT tells me it has a knowledge cutoff of October 2023, so when I ask it who the president is, it says Joe Biden. Yet if I ask for today's weather, it tells me current information. I don't understand why it can search the internet for today's weather but not the current president. Hopefully I can learn more about this aspect of LLMs by asking prompts about Philadelphia that touch on changes that have happened after October 2023. \n"
