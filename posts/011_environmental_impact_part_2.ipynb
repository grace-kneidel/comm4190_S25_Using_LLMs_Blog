    "Earlier on my blog, I asked LLMs with different cutoffs to tell me what they knew about the environmental impact of AI. While the precise answer is pretty unclear, it seems as though an individual LLM query uses, as a *very rough estimate*, 0.01 and 0.05 liters of water. I found that LLMs with more later knowledge cutoffs were somewhat better of producing estimates close to 0.01-0.05 liters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I'm going to see what LLMs have to say about their own environmental impact, expanding the scope to extend beyond just water usage. The source of variation today is going to be using base models vs instruction finetuned models. I'm excited to see what the babbling from the base models will be, and I'm also excited to see what sort of estimates the instruction finetuned models are able to come up with! "

      "Artificial Intelligence, AI, and Machine Learning (ML) can be a game changer when it comes to improving human life by creating better and more efficient products that make our lives easier. However, we should not forget that AI is also capable of wreaking havoc in the ecosystem.\n",
      "AI and machine learning are transforming the way we live and work, from healthcare to agriculture and finance. But as they become smarter and more connected, so too do the risks associated with their use. In this blog post, we will explore what artificial intelligence means for our planet and how it can affect future generations.\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on building intelligent machines. It uses algorithms to understand human language and behavior, create computer programs, and make decisions based on data input.\n",
      "AI has been used in many industries for years now, but its applications are becoming more widespread every day. The potential for negative impacts on our environment can be difficult to predict at first glance, but there are ways we can minimize these effects while still taking advantage of AI’s benefits. Let’s take a closer look!\n",
      "Artificial intelligence has been around since the 1950s and is currently used in a variety of industries such as healthcare, finance, entertainment, and more. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to systems that learn from experience without being explicitly programmed.\n",
      "The term artificial intelligence was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at Dartmouth College’s summer research program for advanced theoretical computer science students (also known as the “Artificial Intelligence Conference”). The conference’s focus on using computing technology to create machines capable of learning and thinking like humans has become a defining aspect of this field today. What are the negative effects of artificial intelligence? | What is the environmental impact of artifical intelligence?\n",
      "How does AI work? Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for a number of technologies that enable computers to think like people do, such as language translation software and self-driving cars.\n",
      "Some experts believe AI will one day surpass humans in intelligence. Others argue it’s just too complicated yet for now.\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence – The Positive Side\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term for a wide range of technologies that enable computers to think like people do. While some experts believe AI will eventually replace human workers, many others say there are still great opportunities to use this technology in the workplace and beyond.\n",
      "What are the negative effects of artificial intelligence? | What is the environmental impact of artifical intelligence?\n",
      "AI can be used for both good and bad reasons; however, it’s important to think about how AI will affect us as individuals and as a society. We’ll explore some potential impacts below:\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence – The Negative Side\n",
      "Negative effects of artificial intelligence are widespread, from the loss of jobs to the creation of new social problems. Artificial intelligence can also lead to environmental degradation due to its reliance on natural resources like water, energy, and minerals.\n",
      "Some experts believe that AI will eventually become more powerful than humans, while others argue it’s just too complicated yet for now.\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence – The Positive Side\n",
      "Positive effects of artificial intelligence are numerous, from better health care to faster decision-making in the workplace. It’s important to understand how we can use this technology to benefit humanity before it becomes a threat instead!\n",
      "Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term that covers various technologies used by computers to mimic human behavior and cognition.\n",
      "Some experts argue that AI will one day surpass humans, while others think there are still great opportunities for using this technology in the workplace and beyond. However, if we don’t plan ahead carefully enough, artificial intelligence could end up doing more harm than good – here are some negative effects of artificial intelligence:\n",
      "What is Artificial Intelligence? | What are its positive & negative aspects?\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a group of technologies that enable computers to think like humans. These include programs such as search engines and speech recognition software, as well as robots capable of moving autonomously through space.\n",
      "In recent years, AI has been used in many areas including healthcare and finance, but its most important applications are likely going to be found elsewhere – from manufacturing processes to transportation systems (self-driving cars), among other things!\n",
      "The negative effects of artificial intelligence include:\n",
      "Artificial Intelligence is a technology that allows computers to mimic human intelligence. It can perform tasks such as learning, decision-making, and problem-solving.\n",
      "Some people argue that AI will eventually replace humans in all roles – from office workers who spend their days typing text messages into machines instead of speaking directly with others (think about those terrible voice assistants), to doctors who rely on software programs rather than consulting actual patients face-to-face when diagnosing diseases!\n",

      "As a designer and creative technologist, I feel passionate about how we design technology to create positive social change. While I enjoy working on projects that make an immediate difference, I'm also inspired by projects that help us better understand the complex relationships between humans and the non-human world.\n",
      "I see myself as part of a movement towards building more equitable systems, technologies and products. As someone who grew up in Canada (now living in NYC) with limited access to nature, I feel strongly about how we can use design and technology to connect people around the globe in order to build stronger, healthier, more sustainable communities.\n",

      "This past year, while working on a project that helped me better understand the relationship between humans and animals (see The Squirrel Project) I was introduced to this amazing organization, Animal Defenders International. They are an incredible group of people who fight for the rights of animals in all forms through education, activism and advocacy.\n",

      "RESPONSE 3 =  It’s a complex question, with many different answers. One thing that is clear is that AI will change how we work and live.\n",
      "One way to look at this is to compare it to electricity. Before electricity, people had to use wood or coal for heat. Then came gas, then oil, then nuclear power. Each new source of energy came with its own set of environmental problems – from pollution to accidents like Chernobyl.\n",
      "With AI, we’re talking about a whole new set of possibilities and risks. The most obvious risk is that AI could be used for evil purposes: to track people or monitor them without their knowledge (think of the NSA’s surveillance programs).\n",
      "But there are also potential benefits from using AI in creative ways. For example, researchers at MIT have been working on making AI more like humans by teaching it how to read our facial expressions and gestures.\n",
      "This means that someday we could have computers that understand what we’re saying or doing without us having to explain everything every time – just as soon as they’re programmed well enough!\n",
      "There are also risks related to privacy and security. As we use more AI systems, the risk grows that information will be leaked accidentally by accident (think of how much data Google collects about its users).\n",
      "Or worse yet: malicious hackers could try to exploit vulnerabilities in these systems for financial gain or political power.\n",
      "So while AI can offer some benefits, there are also risks associated with it as well. The key question is whether they’re worth taking the risk?\n",

      "Artificial intelligence can be used to create content faster than humans. This means that businesses can produce more content quickly and efficiently.\n",
      "The use of AI tools like ChatGPT makes it easier for non-programmers to write code. This is helpful because most people don’t have the time or knowledge needed to develop software on their own.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of computer program that learns from experience in order to improve its performance over time without being explicitly programmed by humans.\n",
