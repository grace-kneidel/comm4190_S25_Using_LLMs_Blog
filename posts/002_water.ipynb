       "The environmental impact of a single query to a large language model (LLM) involves energy consumption and, indirectly, water usage due to the cooling requirements of data centers. According to a paper published in 2020, the carbon footprint of an LLM query is relatively low, often comparable to boiling a kettle of water. However, more recent analyses have not focused explicitly on water usage per query. Instead, they highlight that the energy required for training and operating these models indirectly contributes to water consumption since cooling systems often use water to dissipate heat generated by servers. To provide context, brushing your teeth with the tap running for two minutes can waste about 8 gallons (30 liters) of water, while a single Google search is estimated to consume a fraction of a teaspoon of water (approximately 0.3 ounces), primarily due to the energy-water nexus in data centers (Source: Google Sustainability Report 2021). Although the resource demand per query is minuscule compared to everyday activities like teeth brushing, the cumulative effect of millions of queries can add up, underscoring the importance of optimizing data center efficiency to minimize environmental impacts. \n"

       "The environmental impact of a single query to a large language model (LLM) primarily involves the electricity required to power the data centers where these models are hosted. This electricity consumption indirectly leads to greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the energy sources used. A study by Strubell et al. (2019) estimated that training large AI models can emit as much CO2 as five cars over their lifespans. However, the carbon footprint of a single query is much smaller—approximately equivalent to boiling a kettle of water or turning on an LED light for a few hours, according to estimates by Patterson et al. (2021). In terms of water usage, the water footprint is primarily linked to the cooling requirements of data centers. A report by Google's sustainability team noted that a comparable activity, such as brushing your teeth with the tap running, uses about 2 gallons of water per minute. While precise water usage per query can vary, it's typically less than a fraction of a gallon, making it considerably less intensive than leaving the tap on. These comparisons highlight the relative efficiency of LLM queries in terms of water usage, though the cumulative environmental impact grows with the scale of AI usage.

       "The environmental impact of a single Large Language Model (LLM) query is relatively modest, but it is not negligible, particularly when considering energy consumption and associated water usage. According to recent estimates, a single query can consume about 0.0003 kWh of electricity, which translates to a water footprint of approximately 0.3 liters, assuming typical cooling and power generation methods [source: Patterson et al., 2021]. To put this in perspective, brushing your teeth with the tap running uses about 8 liters of water per minute, meaning a single LLM query uses roughly 1/25th of the water required for one minute of tooth brushing. While the environmental impact of individual queries may appear minimal, the cumulative effect becomes significant given the billions of queries processed daily. Thus, optimizing the energy efficiency of LLMs remains crucial to mitigating their environmental footprint. \n"

       "Producing one almond requires approximately 1.1 gallons (4.16 liters) of water. Almond cultivation has been criticized for its high water usage, particularly in water-stressed regions like California, where a significant portion of the world's almonds are grown. The intensive irrigation needed for almond trees contributes to groundwater depletion and strains local water resources. To put this into context, the water used to produce one almond is roughly equivalent to the amount of water a person uses when brushing their teeth for two minutes with the tap running.

On average, it is estimated that around 1,800 gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef. This includes water used for growing animal feed, watering the animals, and processing the meat. To put this into context, the water footprint of beef production is much higher compared to other water-intensive activities. For instance, the amount of water used to produce one pound of beef is roughly equivalent to the amount of water used when a person brushes their teeth for about six months.

To put this in perspective, the water required to produce one kWh of electricity is roughly equivalent to the amount of water used by an individual for cooking meals daily for about 2 weeks.

       "Recent estimates suggest that a single query to a large language model (LLM) consumes roughly 0.02–0.1 kWh of electricity when one accounts for computing and the associated cooling in data centers. Converting this energy use into the water footprint—given that modern thermoelectric power plants and data centers typically withdraw around 1.5–2 liters of water per kWh for cooling purposes (U.S. Geological Survey data as referenced by the U.S. Department of Energy)—an individual query may indirectly “use” approximately 0.03–0.2 liters of water. In comparison, brushing your teeth can use anywhere from 2 to 4 liters of water, particularly if the tap is left running during the process (EPA WaterSense guidelines provide comparable estimates). Although the carbon emissions per query are estimated to be on the order of a few grams of CO₂ equivalent (see Strubell et al., 2019, \"Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP\"), it is noteworthy that even these seemingly small amounts may aggregate significantly with high volume usage. This comparison underscores that while each LLM query has a relatively low environmental impact on a per-query basis—far less water intensive than everyday activities like toothbrushing—the cumulative effects warrant ongoing efforts toward improved energy efficiency and sustainable infrastructure in AI deployments.  \n",

Recent studies suggest that a single query may consume roughly 0.001–0.01 kWh of energy depending on system optimization and data center efficiency [1]. When considering that many power plants use water for cooling, this energy use translates indirectly to only a few milliliters of water per query—a minuscule amount compared to the roughly 2 liters of water typically wasted during a two-minute toothbrushing session if the tap runs continuously [2].

For instance, well-optimized inference operations may consume only a few hundredths of a watt-hour of energy, which translates into less than one milliliter of water used for data center cooling per query—especially given efficiency improvements in modern data centers (Masanet et al., 2020; Strubell et al., 2019). In stark contrast, brushing your teeth with the tap running for just two minutes can use roughly 2–5 liters of water (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data), making the relative water intensity of an LLM query almost negligible. While the broader environmental concerns regarding LLMs tend to focus on the carbon emissions associated with training large models rather than the tiny water footprint during inference, these numbers help put into perspective that the direct water consumption per LLM query is far less impactful than common water-intensive practices.  \n",

    "One [study](https://e360.yale.edu/features/artificial-intelligence-climate-energy-emissions) from Yale in February 2024 suggests that \"a person who engages in a session of questions and answers with GPT-3 (roughly 10 to 50 responses) drives the consumption of a half-liter of fresh water\". \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we do the math based on this one estimate, each query is somewhere between 0.05 and 0.01 liters of water. But this may vary a lot for other LLM models, too. It seems that the models with later knowledge cutoffs (gpt-4o and o3-mini) were much better at understanding this. "
