Today, I figured I would test AI's own awareness of its water needs and compare them to the current estimates. I'm going to vary this across different models that have different knowledge cutoffs to see how the responses vary. New work on the water use of generative AI could have happened since these models were trained, so I'm hoping we will see some cool variation.\n",

      "The environmental impact of each large language model (LLM) query, specifically in terms of water consumption, is relatively modest when compared to traditional water-intensive activities. Recent estimates suggest that a single LLM query consumes about 0.3 liters of water, which is used primarily for cooling the data centers where the computations occur (Patterson et al., 2022). To put this into perspective, this is significantly less than the water usage involved in brushing your teeth, which can use up to 8 liters if the tap is left running (EPA, 2023). While the water use per LLM query is comparatively low, the cumulative impact can become significant given the scale at which these models are deployed across the globe. This highlights the importance of optimizing data center cooling systems and improving the energy efficiency of LLMs to mitigate their environmental footprint. \n",

      "My knowledge cutoff is October 2023. The environmental impact of each query processed by large language models (LLMs), such as those used in AI chatbots, primarily involves energy consumption and its associated carbon emissions, rather than water usage. However, water is indirectly used in cooling the data centers where these models run. Recent studies suggest that a single LLM query can consume about 0.0003 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, equating to approximately 0.3 grams of CO2 emissions, depending on the energy mix used (Wu et al., 2023). In terms of water usage, a single query is estimated to indirectly require about 0.0005 liters of water, primarily for cooling purposes (Patterson et al., 2023). For context, brushing your teeth with the tap running can use approximately 7.5 liters of water per minute. Therefore, the water footprint of an LLM query is minuscule compared to such activities, highlighting the relatively low direct water demand of these digital interactions. However, as the use of AI continues to scale, the cumulative environmental impacts warrant attention and efforts to improve the sustainability of data centers.\n",

      "The environmental impact of each Large Language Model (LLM) query primarily involves energy consumption, which indirectly contributes to water use, given that water is often used in electricity generation processes. Recent scientific estimates suggest that the carbon and water footprint of a single LLM query can vary significantly depending on the size of the model and the infrastructure efficiency. For instance, a single query on a large-scale LLM might consume approximately 0.5 liters of water, primarily due to the cooling requirements of data centers (Patterson et al., 2021). To put this into context, brushing your teeth with the tap running for two minutes uses about 6 liters of water, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Therefore, while each LLM query represents a small fraction of the water usage of common daily activities, the cumulative impact can be substantial given the scale of LLM deployment and usage globally. It is crucial for data centers to adopt more sustainable energy and water usage practices to mitigate this impact.\n",

      "My knowledge cutoff is October 2023. Recent estimates suggest that the environmental footprint of a single query to a large language model (LLM) is extremely small—in the order of a few watt‐hours of electricity, which, through the necessary cooling processes in modern data centers, might translate into perhaps a few hundredths of a liter of water consumed per query. To put this into perspective, the water used in powering and cooling the servers that handle such a query would be several orders of magnitude lower than the 2–4 liters typically wasted during a two‐minute session of brushing one’s teeth under a running tap (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2022). The rigorous energy and water management protocols now adopted by major cloud providers mean that each LLM query carries a lighter environmental toll than other daily water-intensive activities; indeed, while thousands of queries may collectively contribute to a measurable environmental demand, an individual query’s impact remains negligible relative to everyday water usage. (See also Strubell et al., 2019, for broader energy and policy considerations in machine learning.)\n",

      "Recent estimates indicate that serving a single query to a large language model (LLM) consumes on the order of 0.1–0.3 watt‐hours (Wh) of energy, though values vary with model size, hardware efficiency, and data center design (Strubell et al., 2019). In data centers that use water-based cooling systems, roughly 1–2 liters of water may be consumed per kilowatt‐hour generated (U.S. Department of Energy, 2020), which implies that the water footprint per LLM query is in the order of 0.0001–0.0006 liters—extremely small in absolute terms. To put this in perspective, brushing your teeth typically uses between 2 and 5 liters of water per session, especially if the tap runs continuously, meaning that the water used per LLM query is several orders of magnitude lower than that of a single dental hygiene routine. However, while the water and energy costs of an individual query are minute, the vast aggregate demand from billions of queries underscores the importance of improving data center efficiency and pursuing greener AI technologies.

      "My knowledge cutoff is 2023-10. Recent research shows that while large language model (LLM) queries do have an environmental impact, the water usage per query is very low compared to everyday activities. LLMs run on data centers that require electricity and cooling, with cooling systems in water-cooled facilities typically consuming anywhere from a few milliliters to a few tens of milliliters of water per kilowatt‐hour of processing, depending on the technology and local energy mix (Shehabi et al., 2016). For a single query that might use on the order of 10 Wh, the attributable water use can be roughly estimated in the range of 10–50 ml. In contrast, a standard two-minute session of brushing your teeth with the tap running can easily use 1–2 liters of water (U.S. EPA), meaning that even on a water-intensive day, the water footprint from an individual LLM query is orders of magnitude smaller. These comparisons underscore that while optimizing AI infrastructure for reduced energy and water use is important, the water use per query remains relatively minor when set against typical domestic water consumption practices.
